**bewafa hai ghadi**

time betrays me  
it holds my hand 
only to slip away  
when the ground beneath feels steady.

my heart stands still,  
its wall laden  
with echoes of laughter  
that is already seeping into the void  
left by yesterday.

time does not turn back.  
it leaves one stranded
holding the weight of what was, 
and the hollow ache  
of what may never come.

but even as time flees,  
i gather its traces, the remnants
with a smile here and a whisper there,  
tiny fragments of forever  
stitched into my soul.
i let them linger,  
soft and bittersweet,  
like the warmth of a hug  
long after it's gone.
